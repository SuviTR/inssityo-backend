# APARTMENT

Apartments are real life properties listed by their owners, landlords into the service. Non-landlord users can then contact the landlord to apply for the apartment to become tenants in it either by themselves or in a group. The apartment model holds important information about the property.

References to the apartment owner and interested tenants-to-be are also held in the model for future communication features.
